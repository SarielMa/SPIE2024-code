## A general approach to improve adversarial robustness of DNNs for medical image segmentation and detection

To install the basic yolov5, please refer to  https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5

The dataset is downloaded from https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset

train.py to train the model without adversarial training;

train_AT.py to train the model with vanilla adversarial Training (VAT);

train_Ours.py to train the model with our proposed defense method;

train_TE_L2.py to train the model with TEAT adversarial training method;

train_TRADES_L2.py to train the model with TRADES adversarial training method.
